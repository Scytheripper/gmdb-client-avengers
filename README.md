# gMDB Client Project

Welcome to the gMDB client project. We're excited to have you build this project for us.

## Requirements

- Your team may also be building a backend API or other services. If so, this client needs to connect to those.
- Users should be able to browse our movie database
- Users can browse anonymously
- Users can also register to be able to review the movies
- Users can login
- Users can reset their password
- Users can create lists for movies (watch list, favorites, etc)

We expect at least 1 update per day (via PR)

## Stakeholders

It would be nice if we could add the following features, but they are not required:

- Movies have star ratings in addition to reviews.

Please contact stakeholders if you need any clarity on the requirements.
